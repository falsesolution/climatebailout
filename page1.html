Over the same time period, oil, coal and gas assets worth trillions will need to be retired in a way that delivers justice to the least responsible for and hardest hit by climate breakdown.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The Climate Bailout is a campaign exploring the economic mechanisms by which we can ‘lock-in’ the end of fossil fuels and the organising practices that we’ll need in order to rise to the challenge.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Over the last months the Covid19 pandemic has blown open the window of possibility. Things that were unthinkable now seem not only desirable, but reasonable and achievable.  Major industrial sectors have received significant sums of newly created government money (aka bailouts) through a process known as ‘quantitative easing’. Sectors such as aviation and shipping, for example, have been handed out hundreds of billions € in government bailouts in order to avoid collapse. But the public backed money provided by governments to these private profit driven corporations has been given with ZERO conditions.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>In order to lock in the end of fossil fuels a ‘Climate Bailout’ - central bank money created in order to absorb the losses from fossil fuel companies in exchange for money that must be invested in additional renewable energy capacity - is a potentially game changing framing to help us kick off that process. What conditions any climate bailout comes with is a crucial question that we’d like to explore with youth organisers moving forward.</strong><br></p><p><strong><br></strong></p></div>

                                       The Climate Bailout is a new campaign supported by LINGO, New Economics Foundation and the World Future Council. While the technical details are still in the early stages of development, there is a deep enough understanding - i.e. that we need to organise for a swift, managed retirement of the fossil fuel industry - to start to engage more people in the development of the movement building aspects of this campaign.</p>
